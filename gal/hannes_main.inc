/* This implements almost all the logic required by the 256 kB RAM Expansion for the Commodore 16/Plus 4 designed by
 * Hannes, as drawn in the schematics by Solder/Synergy.
 *
 * The memory of 256kB is divided in 4 64kB banks. You can only use 240kB, because you can't switch memory lower than
 * $1000. A further restriction is possible if you use bit 7. The control register for the expansion is located at
 * address $FD16 (64790):
 *
 * - Bit 0/1: Select RAM-bank (0-3), standard is RAM-bank 3
 * - Bit 4/5: Leave these set to 1 for compatibility with the expansion by CSORY
 * - Bit 6: "TED-feature", added in "Update 1":
 *   - 1: Allows TED access to RAM (for text, graphic) to RAM-bank selected with bits 0 and 1
 *   - 0: TED access to RAM only in bank 3, bits 0 and 1 ignored
 * - Bit 7: Set the switch-bound:
 *   - 0: >$0fff
 *   - 1: >$3fff
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Before you activate the expansion you should initialize this control register. You can't read this register.
 * - After switch-on the plus/4 all bits are "1". The standard bank is bank 3.
 * - Bank 3 is always in the nonswitchable area.
 *
 * This GAL implements all the glue logic shown in the schematics by Solder/Synergy, *except* the 6529B implementing the
 * control register. Since that IC is not easy to find these days, we'll find an alternative, probably involving a
 * 74HCT273.

/* RAM Register /CS (replace HCT138)
 * The idea is to intercept the Userport /CS range ($FD10-FD1F, PLA pin 16) and further decode it, feeding $FD10 to its
 * original purpose and using the remaining addresses for other stuff. In particular, $FD16 will be the control register
 * for our RAM expansion (see ioarea.txt for further address assignments).
 * Note: the Userport /CS range is also known as "Cassette" on the C16 schematics, as it actually has no Userport.
 * Note2: On the +4, the track between pin 16 of the PLA (U19) and pin 19 of the 6529 controlling the Userport (U5)
 *        must be cut and the two sides must be connected to the corresponding pins below.
